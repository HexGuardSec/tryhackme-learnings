# 📘 TryHackMe Learnings

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my learning journey on **TryHackMe**, focusing on **cybersecurity fundamentals, SOC concepts, and system-oriented security knowledge**.

It is used as a **structured learning log** to capture:
- key concepts
- operational logic
- investigation methodologies

rather than as a full technical lab repository.

Hands-on, enterprise-style scenarios (Linux and Windows audits, incidents, remediation) are documented separately in dedicated repositories.

## 🎯 Scope of Learning

Through TryHackMe, I focus on understanding how security and IT operate in **real-world environments**, especially for:

- SOC Tier 1 operations
- Alert triage and reporting
- Security awareness (e.g. phishing)
- System and network fundamentals
- The relationship between security monitoring and Internal IT operations

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **cybersecurity-101/**  
  → Module-by-module notes from the *Cyber Security 101* learning path, covering foundational security concepts.

- **SOC_L1_Fundamentals_and_Phishing.md**  
  → Learning notes and takeaways related to:
  - SOC Level 1 alert triage
  - incident reporting
  - SOC metrics and objectives
  - phishing investigation simulation

- **screenshots/**

## 🧠 Purpose of This Repository

- Consolidate my cybersecurity and SOC-related knowledge in a structured way
- Document what I learn to reinforce understanding
- Show continuous progression and learning discipline
- Complement my **Internal IT, Windows, and Linux** hands-on projects
- Provide context to my technical profile for recruiters and hiring managers

This repository is **not meant to replace** enterprise-style labs, but to **support and contextualize them**.

---

## 🧭 Learning Philosophy

- Focus on **understanding workflows and decision-making**, not just tools
- Emphasis on:
  - analysis
  - documentation
  - clarity of communication
- Avoiding purely offensive or CTF-style learning when it does not align with enterprise reality

This approach aligns with **Internal IT, System Administration, and SOC Tier 1 roles**.

---

## 📅 Notes

- This repository documents my TryHackMe learnings starting from **December 2025**
- Previously completed modules (such as Linux Fundamentals, Windows Fundamentals, etc.) are **not retroactively documented**
- Only modules relevant to my current learning objectives are included

## 🚀 Long-Term Goal

To become a **capable Junior Internal IT / SOC professional**, ready to work in a **Japanese or international enterprise environment** in 2026, with strong foundations in:

- system administration
- security awareness
- alert triage
- incident analysis and reporting

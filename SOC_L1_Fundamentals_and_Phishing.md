# 🛡️ SOC Level 1 – Fundamentals & Phishing Simulation

## 📌 Overview

This section documents my learning and hands-on understanding of **SOC Level 1 fundamentals**, with a focus on **alert triage, reporting, and phishing investigation**.

The goal is not offensive security, but to understand how a **SOC analyst operates in real environments**, how alerts are handled, and how incidents are documented clearly for escalation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the role and responsibilities of a **SOC Level 1 analyst**
- Learn how alerts are triaged and classified
- Practice **clear incident reporting**
- Understand SOC metrics and operational objectives
- Apply this knowledge in a **phishing investigation simulation**

---

## 📚 Modules Covered

### 🔹 SOC L1 Alert Triage
- Understanding alert context and severity
- Identifying false positives vs true positives
- Initial investigation steps
- Knowing when and how to escalate

---

### 🔹 SOC L1 Alert Reporting
- Writing clear, structured incident reports
- Focusing on:
  - what happened
  - who is affected
  - impact
  - next steps
- Avoiding assumptions and sticking to observable facts

---

### 🔹 SOC Workbooks and Lookups
- Using structured data sources to support investigations
- Understanding how lookups help analysts:
  - enrich alerts
  - validate indicators
  - gain context quickly

---

### 🔹 SOC Metrics and Objectives
- Understanding why SOCs track:
  - Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)
  - Mean Time To Respond (MTTR)
  - Alert volume
- Learning how metrics reflect SOC efficiency and workload

---

## 🧪 Practical Simulation – Introduction to Phishing

### Scenario Summary
- Analysis of a suspected phishing email
- Identification of:
  - suspicious sender information
  - abnormal links
  - social engineering techniques
- Determining whether the alert represents a real threat

### Key Takeaways
- Many phishing alerts rely on **context**, not just indicators
- User awareness and reporting are critical
- Clear documentation is essential for escalation or closure

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- SOC Level 1 work is primarily about **analysis, judgment, and documentation**
- Not every alert is malicious, but every alert must be handled seriously
- Clear reporting is as important as technical investigation
- SOC fundamentals strongly complement **Internal IT and system administration**, especially for detection and auditing

---

## 🔗 Relation to My Other Labs

This SOC learning complements my other projects:
- Linux incident response scenarios
- Windows internal IT audits
- User privilege and persistence analysis

The SOC perspective improves my ability to:
- detect abnormal behavior
- document incidents professionally
- communicate findings clearly
